    "# Web Scraping Information for Maricopa County, AZ HIV Testing Sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science has many tools that could potentially make public health research much more efficient and streamlined. For example, I am helping a professor create and gather data for follow-up analyses of a study they published this year. One of those datasets is a database of all the HIV testing and PrEP provider sites in the US. I was originally going to manually create the spreadsheet, which admittedly is very time-consuming and could lead to many errors. In my self-directed study of data science, I have run into the idea of web scraping but haven't tackled it yet as I didn't feel prepared to attempt it. However, I decided to just look up tutorials on webscraping in an attempt to implement it to save myself time. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found a great article from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460) on implementing web scraping in Python. The tutorial implements the library, BeautifulSoup, to perform the web scraping. I decided to try to follow the tutorial to accomplish creating that spreadsheet of the information I need just for the HIV testing sites in Maricopa County, Arizona as a test before implementing it for all sites from [PrEP Locator](https://preplocator.org/)."

From the inspection, you can see all the headings and subheadings in the underlying HTML code. In the subheadings, the text of the information I need is grouped together and organized. "

    "As I was attempting the first step of importing the url, I learned I need to find another way to extract the results you get when you use the web app. From looking through Stack Overflow, I am being pointed to look at the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) of a webpage to extract the results related to the API (Application Programming Interface). When you use imbedded web apps, that the results are stored in JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to follow the web scraping tutorial found [here](http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/). In the window that appears when you inspect the webpage, we need to go to 'Network', and we'll need to filter for XHR (XMLHttpRequest). After searching a few different counties in the web app, I was able to find the code that spits out the results. Its name starts with, \"admis-ajax.php...\" I then copied the request URL, and ran the suggested code from the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I then learned that websites have underlying permissions for web scraping found in their robots.txt file. So, I reached a dead-end in trying to scrape the AIDSVu website. Luckily, from looking around the code, it seems I may have access to the same dataset through a different website, so I decided to web scrape the [PrEP Locator website](https://preplocator.org/), whose permissions allow me to web scrape. \n",

    "In this project, I was attempting to speed up a data collection process by web scraping. I learned a lot from just this short project, from web scraping permissions to the underlying scaffolding of websites and their accompanying APIs. This tool can be really beneficial for extracting data from web pages and online databases especially for those in public health where the website's data may not be requestable. \n",
    "\n",
    "My next step is to try to find a way to pass a list of the 3,000 or so counties in the US into the API, extract the JSON data from all of the results, and compile them all into one file. \n",

    "I would like to thank Google Search, the various posters on Stack Overflow, and the many people who have written articles about how to address certain data wrangling problems. "
