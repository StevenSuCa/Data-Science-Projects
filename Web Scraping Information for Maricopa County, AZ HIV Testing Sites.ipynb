    "# Web Scraping Information for Maricopa County, AZ HIV Testing Sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science has many tools that could potentially make public health research much more efficient and streamlined. For example, I am helping a professor create and gather data of all the HIV testing and PrEP provider sites in the US that reside in the counties that account for 50% of new HIV diagnoses. I was originally going to manually create the spreadsheet, which admittedly is very time-consuming and could lead to many errors. In my self-directed study of data science, I have run into the idea of web scraping but haven't tackled it yet as I didn't feel prepared to attempt it. However, I decided to just look up tutorials on webscraping in an attempt to implement it to save myself time. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found a great article from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460) on implementing web scraping in Python. The tutorial implements the library, BeautifulSoup, to perform the web scraping. I decided to try to follow the tutorial to accomplish creating that spreadsheet of the information I need just for the HIV testing sites in Maricopa County, Arizona as a test before implementing it for all sites from [PrEP Locator](https://preplocator.org/)."

From the inspection, you can see all the headings and subheadings in the underlying HTML code. In the subheadings, the text of the information I need is grouped together and organized. "

When you use imbedded web apps, that the results are stored in JSON or XML.\n",

    "I decided to follow the web scraping tutorial found [here](http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/). In the window that appears when you inspect the webpage, we need to go to 'Network', and we'll need to filter for XHR (XMLHttpRequest). After searching a few different counties in the web app, I was able to find the code that spits out the results. Its name starts with, \"admis-ajax.php...\" I then copied the request URL, and ran the suggested code from the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I then learned that websites have underlying permissions for web scraping found in their robots.txt file. So, I reached a dead-end in trying to scrape the AIDSVu website. Luckily, from looking around the code, it seems I may have access to the same dataset through a different website, so I decided to web scrape the [PrEP Locator website](https://preplocator.org/), whose permissions allow me to web scrape. \n",

    "In this project, I was attempting to speed up a data collection process by web scraping. I learned a lot from just this short project, from web scraping permissions to the underlying scaffolding of websites and their accompanying APIs. This tool can be really beneficial for extracting data from web pages and online databases especially for those in public health where the website's data may not be requestable. \n",
